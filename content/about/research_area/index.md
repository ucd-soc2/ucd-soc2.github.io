1. **Sustainable Orchestration in Edge–Cloud and Multi-Cloud Environments**: We design mechanisms for energy-efficient, carbon-aware orchestration across diverse computing infrastructures, from edge devices to federated and multi-cloud platforms. Our work covers dynamic service placement, task scheduling, and resource provisioning that balance performance, cost, and environmental impact, leveraging advanced networking platforms such as MEC, B5G, 6G, and SAGIN to enable next-generation resilient and sustainable urban infrastructures.

2. **LLM@Edge and Distributed LLMs**: We investigate the deployment and optimisation of large language models at the network edge to deliver low-latency, resource-efficient AI services. Our research also advances distributed LLM architectures, including Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, enabling scalable and sustainable AI across the edge–cloud continuum. Applications include real-time urban analytics, building energy optimisation, and other sustainability-driven domains.
