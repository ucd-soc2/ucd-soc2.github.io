We are building a network of collaborators across academia, industry, and policy who share
our vision for sustainable computing and edge intelligence. Our work spans the
edge–to–cloud continuum, with expertise in renewable-aware orchestration, distributed AI
deployment, and sustainable networking infrastructures. We welcome collaboration in areas
such as:

- **Joint proposal development** for national and international research calls
- **Co-supervision of PhD projects** and student exchanges
- **Shared datasets, tools, and testbeds** to advance open science
- **Pilot studies and proof-of-concept projects** with industry and community partners
