SOC2: Sustainable Orchestration in Computing Continuum Lab is a research group at the School of Computer Science, University College Dublin (UCD). The lab focuses on sustainable computing, energy and resource efficiency, and carbon-aware system design in the context of edge-to-cloud continuum. The lab's research also explores the challenges of deploying AI-based applications, including large language models (LLMs), in edge and distributed environments.

The lab is led by Hadi Tabatabaee Malazi, an Assistant Professor at UCD. The lab welcomes opportunities to connect with students, researchers, and industry collaborators interested in sustainable edge-cloud systems and the deployment of large language models (LLMs), including distributed and edge-based LLMs.

The lab's research areas include:

- Sustainable computing
- Energy and resource efficiency
- Carbon-aware system design
- Edge-to-cloud continuum
- AI-based applications
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Distributed and edge-based LLMs

The lab is also involved in various research projects to develop innovative solutions for sustainable computing and AI deployment.
