Hadi Tabatabaee Malazi is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science, University College Dublin (UCD), where he leads the Sustainable Orchestration in Computing Continuum (SOC² Lab). His research focuses on orchestrating services and workloads across the edge–to–cloud continuum, emphasizing sustainable computing, energy and resource efficiency, and carbon-aware system design. His work also explores the challenges of deploying AI-based applications, including large language models (LLMs), in edge and distributed environments.

He received his PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Isfahan (2012), with a research visit to Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in 2010–2011. Prior to joining UCD, he held academic and research positions at Maynooth University, Shahid Beheshti University, and within the ENABLE research program at CONNECT, Trinity College Dublin.

Hadi is a Senior Member of the IEEE, an Associate Editor at IEEE Access, and actively contributes as a Technical Program Committee member for several IEEE conferences. He also serves on the Management Committee of COST Action CA22151 (CYPHER), which focuses on decarbonizing energy-intensive industries through cyber-physical systems.

He welcomes opportunities to connect with students, researchers, and industry collaborators interested in sustainable edge–cloud systems and the deployment of large language models (LLMs), including distributed and edge-based LLMs.
