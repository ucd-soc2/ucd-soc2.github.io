Edge Cloud and Sustainability is a research area that focuses on the intersection of edge computing, cloud computing, and sustainability. It explores how edge and cloud technologies can be leveraged to create more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly computing systems.

This area of research is becoming increasingly important as the demand for computing power continues to grow, and concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact become more pressing. By optimizing the use of edge and cloud resources, researchers aim to reduce energy consumption, minimize carbon emissions, and improve the overall sustainability of computing systems.

The research in this area includes topics such as:

- Energy-efficient algorithms and architectures for edge and cloud computing
- Carbon-aware resource management and scheduling
- Sustainable data center design and operation
- Edge and cloud resource optimization for IoT applications
- Green networking and communication protocols
- Life cycle assessment of edge and cloud computing systems
