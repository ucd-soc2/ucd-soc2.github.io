## About SOC2 Lab

SOC2: Sustainable Orchestration in Computing Continuum Lab is a research group at the School of Computer Science, University College Dublin (UCD). The lab focuses on sustainable computing, energy and resource efficiency, and carbon-aware system design in the context of edge-to-cloud continuum. The lab's research also explores the challenges of deploying AI-based applications, including large language models (LLMs), in edge and distributed environments.

The lab is led by Hadi Tabatabaee Malazi, an Assistant Professor at UCD. The lab welcomes opportunities to connect with students, researchers, and industry collaborators interested in sustainable edge-cloud systems and the deployment of large language models (LLMs), including distributed and edge-based LLMs.

**Research areas include:**
- Sustainable computing
- Energy and resource efficiency
- Carbon-aware system design
- Edge-to-cloud continuum
