# SOC2 Lab

The Sustainable Orchestration in Computing Continuum Lab (SOC2 Lab) is a research group at the School of Computer Science, University College Dublin. Led by Dr. Hadi Tabatabaee Malazi, the lab focuses on sustainable computing, energy and resource efficiency, and carbon-aware system design in the context of edge-to-cloud continuum. The lab's research also explores the challenges of deploying AI-based applications, including large language models (LLMs), in edge and distributed environments.
