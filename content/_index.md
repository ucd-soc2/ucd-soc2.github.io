# Sustainable Orchestration in Computing Continuum Lab

The Sustainable Orchestration in Computing Continuum Lab (*SOCÂ² Lab*) is a research lab at the School of Computer Science, University College Dublin.

Led by Dr. Hadi Tabatabaee Malazi, the lab focuses on sustainable computing, energy and resource efficiency, and carbon-aware system design in the context of edge-to-cloud continuum. The lab's research also explores harnessing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of computing systems.
